# Monte Carlo integrator for dark matter annihilations

## Introduction
This project aims at the evaluation of <\sigma v> of annihilations/scatterings of dark matter models, where \sigma is the cross-section and v is velocity of dark matter particles.

## Requirements
Python 3 with numpy and matplotlib.

## How to use it
By modifying integrand.py, you are able to insert the function of your interest as the integrand. The integrand provided in this program is a naive 1/s * v with a Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution.
